Is it possible you meant MajorMUD or one of these related projects? Or is "majornudd" a specific tool or fork you've come across? If you can give me a bit more context (where you heard about it, what it does), I can do a more targeted search.Yes majormudFeb 5Investigated MajorMUD's open source status and related projectsThe user is asking about MajorMUD and whether it's open source now. Let me search for more specific information about MajorMUD's licensing status and whether it has been released as open source.MajorMUD open source released 202510 resultsReleases · mbbsemu/MBBSEmugithub.commajormud · GitHub Topics · GitHubgithub.comGitHub - maldorne/awesome-muds: A curated list of MUD development resources, tools, and apps.github.comGitHub · Where software is builtgithub.comReleases · lucid2310/Majormudgithub.comBest Open Source Mac Multi-User Dungeons (MUD) Games 2026sourceforge.netBest Open Source Windows Multi-User Dungeons (MUD) Games 2026sourceforge.netGitHub - pdxcode/PDXMUD: This is an opensource project to recreate the West Coast Creations BBS game MajorMUD. MajorMUD was a text-based fantasy game owned by West Coast Creations in the 90's. It currently requires a Windows XP or older machine to run and quite a bit of installation. The goal with this project is to get the whole game re-created using HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript and get it into a playable form in a browser. It is not intended for re-sale, profit or anything of this nature. It is a project igithub.comGitHub - Blixxky/majormud: An archival and teardown repo of the classic 1994 text based MORPG game MajorMUDgithub.commudinfo.net - Index pagewww.mudinfo.netBased on my search results, I can now provide a comprehensive answer about MajorMUD's open source status. The original MajorMUD game itself is NOT open source - it was proprietary software created by West Coast Creations in 1994, sold to Metropolis in 1999, and development ended when Metropolis shut down in 2008.
However, there are several open source projects related to MajorMUD:

MBBSEmu - An open source emulator that can run MajorMUD and other MajorBBS/Worldgroup modules
ReMUD - A MajorMUD implementation in C#
PDXMUD - An open source project to recreate MajorMUD in HTML5/CSS3/JavaScript
Various tools like Nightmare Redux, MMUD Explorer, etc.

The original game's source code has never been released as open source. The community has created alternative ways to run and modify it through emulation and recreation projects.Show moreDoneBased on my search, MajorMUD itself is not open source - the original game remains proprietary. Development ended when Metropolis Gameport shut down in April 2008, and the source code was never released.
However, there's a thriving community keeping it alive through several open source projects:
MBBSEmu is the big one - it's an open source, cross-platform emulator that lets you run MajorMUD (and other MajorBBS/Worldgroup modules) without needing the original infrastructure. It's actively maintained with updates as recent as late 2025.
There are also several open source tools and recreation projects:

ReMUD - A MajorMUD implementation in C#
Nightmare Redux - An editor for MajorMUD databases, with a version modified for MBBSEmu
MMUD Explorer - A database viewer
PDXMUD - A project attempting to recreate MajorMUD in HTML5/JavaScript for browser play

The mudinfo.net community is still active with people running BBSes, creating custom areas, and sharing modifications.
So while the original code isn't open source, you can absolutely run MajorMUD today using MBBSEmu plus the original game files. Were you thinking of setting up a server, or just curious about the state of things?I want to experiment with using majormud code but making it a graphics gameFeb 5Examined multiple technical approaches for graphicalizing legacy MUD codebaseThe user wants to take MajorMUD and convert it into a graphical game. This is an interesting project idea. Let me think about what's available and what approaches they could take:

MajorMUD itself isn't open source, but there are open source implementations and tools
ReMUD is a C# implementation that could potentially be modified
They could use MBBSEmu as a backend and build a graphical frontend
They could use the database files/data and build something new on top

Let me think about the technical approaches:

Frontend overlay approach: Keep MajorMUD running (via MBBSEmu) and build a graphical client that interprets the text output and renders it graphically. This is similar to how some MUD clients work with graphical maps.
Full recreation: Use one of the open source reimplementations (like ReMUD) as a base and add graphics rendering.
Data extraction + new engine: Extract the game data (monsters, items, maps, etc.) from MajorMUD's Btrieve databases using tools like Nightmare or MMUD Explorer, then build a new graphical game engine that uses that data.

Given the user's background in DevOps and their interest in D&D, this could be a fun project. I should ask what kind of graphics they're thinking (2D tile-based? Isometric? 3D?) and what their preferred tech stack might be.Show moreDoneThat's a cool project idea! There are a few approaches you could take:
1. Graphical Client/Frontend
Build a graphical client that connects to MajorMUD (running on MBBSEmu) and interprets the text stream to render graphics. You'd parse the output (room descriptions, combat messages, etc.) and display it visually. This keeps the game logic intact while adding a visual layer.
2. Fork ReMUD
The C# implementation (ReMUD) on GitHub would give you actual game logic to work with. You could gut the text rendering and replace it with a graphics engine. C# plays nicely with Unity or MonoGame.
3. Data Extraction + New Engine
Use Nightmare or MMUD Explorer to dump all the game data (rooms, monsters, items, spells, maps) from the Btrieve databases, then build a completely new graphical engine that consumes that data. Most flexible but most work.
Some questions to help narrow it down:

What style of graphics are you thinking? 2D tile-based (like classic Ultima), isometric, or 3D?
Are you wanting to preserve the multiplayer BBS aspect or make it single-player?
What's your preferred language/engine? Given your DevOps background, something like Godot (GDScript or C#), Unity, or even a web-based approach with Phaser.js could work.

The room/map data in MajorMUD is actually pretty well structured - it would translate reasonably well to a tile-based or node-based graphical map system.I want it to be real time, pvx, and I think isometric would be fun if easy to implement with good graphicsFeb 5Weighed engine options and architecture for isometric real-time multiplayer gameThe user wants to create a graphical version of MajorMUD that is:

Real-time (not turn-based like original MajorMUD)
PvX (PvE + PvP)
Isometric graphics
Good graphics that are easy to implement

This is a significant undertaking. Let me think about the best approach:
For isometric games with good graphics that are relatively easy to implement:

Godot has decent 2D isometric support
Unity has isometric toolkits
There are also asset packs available for isometric RPGs

For real-time conversion - the original MajorMUD was tick-based, so converting to real-time would require rethinking combat, movement, etc.
For the data extraction approach - they could use the MajorMUD data (items, monsters, spells, rooms) as a starting point but would need to redesign the game loop.
Let me give practical advice on:

Engine choice for isometric
Asset sources for good isometric graphics
Architecture considerations for real-time multiplayer
How to leverage existing MajorMUD data

Given his DevOps background with containerization and cloud experience, I should mention server architecture considerations too.Show moreDoneIsometric is very doable, and there are some great asset packs that can give you a polished look without needing an artist on day one.
Engine Recommendation: Godot 4
Godot has solid isometric support built-in with its TileMap node (supports isometric, staggered, and hexagonal layouts). It's free, open source, lightweight, and exports to Windows/Linux/Mac/Web. The GDScript is easy to pick up, or you can use C# if you prefer.
Asset Packs to Look At

Humble Bundle frequently has isometric RPG asset bundles
itch.io has tons of isometric tilesets (search "isometric RPG")
Kenney.nl has free isometric packs that are surprisingly good
LPC (Liberated Pixel Cup) assets - huge community library, though more top-down than isometric

Architecture for Real-Time PvX
This is where it gets interesting. You'd want:

Authoritative server - handles all game state, combat calculations, loot drops
Client - renders the world, sends player input, interpolates positions
Networking - WebSockets or UDP depending on how twitchy you want combat

Given your containerization experience, you could run the game server in Docker, potentially scale zones horizontally with Kubernetes if you get ambitious.
The Real-Time Conversion Challenge
MajorMUD was tick-based (actions resolved every 10 seconds or so). For real-time you'd need to redesign:

Movement (free movement vs tile-to-tile)
Combat (cooldowns, hitboxes or tab-target, action queueing)
Spell casting (cast times, interrupts)

Want me to sketch out a basic architecture or help you pull together a prototype plan?How much more difficult is full 3d engine?Feb 5Weighed development complexity, assets, and performance across engine optionsThe user is asking about the difficulty difference between isometric 2D and full 3D for their MajorMUD graphical remake. Let me think through the key differences and considerations.
Key factors:

Development complexity
Asset creation/acquisition
Performance considerations
Engine options
Networking complexity (doesn't really change)
Time to prototype

I should give an honest assessment - 3D is harder but not insurmountably so, especially with modern engines.Show moreDoneHonestly? Not as bad as it used to be, but there are some real tradeoffs.
What Gets Harder

What Stays About the Same

Game logic, combat systems, item/spell databases
Server architecture
UI/HUD work (often 2D overlay anyway)
Networking protocol design

3D Engine Options

Godot 4 - 3D has improved massively, good for indie scope
Unity - Huge asset store, tons of tutorials, C# which you know
Unreal - Overkill for this, steeper learning curve

The Asset Problem is Real
This is the killer. For isometric you can buy a complete tileset for $30 and have a cohesive world. For 3D you need:

Character models (each race/class)
Animations (walk, run, attack, cast, die - per weapon type)
Environment models
Monsters (hundreds in MajorMUD)

Middle Ground: Low-Poly 3D
Games like Albion Online or early RuneScape prove you can do stylized low-poly 3D that looks good and is easier to produce. There are asset packs in this style too.
What's drawing you toward 3D - the gameplay feel, or the aesthetic?Isometric like Albion can seem cheapFeb 5Examined aesthetic concerns and clarified isometric game perception nuancesThe user is saying that isometric games like Albion Online can feel cheap or low quality. They might be reconsidering the isometric approach. Let me address this and maybe explore what they're really after aesthetically.
Albion Online is actually isometric/top-down, not full 3D first-person. It uses a 3D engine with an isometric camera. So the user might be conflating a few things here, or they might be saying that the Albion style specifically feels cheap to them.
I should clarify what they mean - are they talking about:

The low-poly art style feeling cheap
The fixed isometric camera feeling limiting
The overall "mobile game" vibe some isometric games have

And help them figure out what aesthetic they actually want. Maybe show some examples of different styles that hit different marks.Show moreDoneFair point. Albion has that mobile-game-adjacent look that can feel a bit flat and sterile despite being technically 3D.
What's the aesthetic you're actually after? Some reference points:
Stylized but Premium Feel

Hades (isometric but dripping with style)
Diablo 2 Resurrected (isometric, hand-crafted feel)
Divinity: Original Sin 2 (isometric, rich and detailed)

3D with Character

Valheim (low-poly but atmospheric as hell)
Dark Souls / Elden Ring (obviously AAA scope, but the vibe)
Morrowind (dated graphics but oozes atmosphere)

Somewhere in Between

Lost Ark (isometric ARPG, flashy combat)
Path of Exile (gritty, detailed isometric)

The difference between "cheap" and "stylish" often comes down to:

Lighting and atmosphere
Animation quality (this is huge)
Consistent art direction
Post-processing effects (bloom, color grading, fog)

A well-lit, well-animated low-poly game beats a poorly executed high-fidelity one every time.
Given MajorMUD's dark fantasy roots - dungeons, undead, dragons, ancient ruins - something with a grittier Diablo/Path of Exile atmosphere might fit better than Albion's bright clean look anyway.
What games hit the visual tone you'd want for this?Show me pictures of all optionsFeb 5Curated visual references across multiple game aestheticsThe user wants to see visual examples of the games I mentioned as reference points. I can search for images of these games and display them. Let me search for screenshots of these various games to show the different aesthetic options.
I should search for screenshots of:

Hades (stylized isometric)
Diablo 2 Resurrected (isometric, hand-crafted)
Divinity: Original Sin 2 (isometric, rich)
Valheim (low-poly atmospheric 3D)
Lost Ark (isometric ARPG)
Path of Exile (gritty isometric)

Let me do a few searches to gather images.Show moreDoneI can search for screenshots, but I can't display images directly in chat - I'd just be giving you links to click through.
Honestly, the fastest way is to just YouTube or Google Image search these:
Isometric/Top-Down

"Hades gameplay" - stylized, vibrant, incredible animations
"Diablo 2 Resurrected gameplay" - dark fantasy, hand-painted feel
"Path of Exile gameplay" - gritty, dark, complex
"Divinity Original Sin 2 gameplay" - rich, detailed, colorful
"Lost Ark gameplay" - flashy, Korean MMO style

3D Options

"Valheim gameplay" - low-poly but moody and atmospheric
"V Rising gameplay" - isometric-ish vampire survival, gothic
"Morrowind gameplay" - dated but unique atmosphere

Dark Fantasy Specifically

"Dark and Darker gameplay" - dungeon crawler, first-person but the vibe fits MajorMUD's feel

V Rising might actually be worth a close look - it's got that dark fantasy PvX thing going, survival elements, and a visual style that doesn't feel cheap despite not being photorealistic.

V Rising is probably the closest reference for what you're describing - dark fantasy, real-time, PvX, isometric-ish camera but 3D rendered, and it doesn't look cheap.I can't click the linksFeb 5Pivoted toward practical search term alternativesThe user can't click the links - they might be on mobile or the interface doesn't render them as clickable. Let me just give them the search terms to use directly in Google Images or YouTube instead, which would be more practical.DoneJust search these directly in Google Images or YouTube:
Google Images:

"Hades game gameplay"
"Diablo 2 Resurrected gameplay"
"Path of Exile 2 gameplay"
"V Rising gameplay"
"Valheim gameplay"
"Dark and Darker gameplay"

YouTube (better for seeing it in motion):

"Hades gameplay no commentary"
"V Rising gameplay 2024"
"Path of Exile 2 gameplay"
"Valheim gameplay"
"Dark and Darker gameplay"

V Rising is probably your best reference point - dark fantasy PvX with that camera angle, doesn't look cheap, and has real-time combat. Start there.V rising is perfect. That is isometric?Feb 5Clarified V Rising's 3D isometric-style perspective distinctionThe user is asking if V Rising is isometric. V Rising uses a top-down/isometric-style camera angle, but it's actually fully 3D rendered - not traditional 2D isometric sprites. It's sometimes called "isometric" colloquially because of the camera perspective, but technically it's a 3D game with a fixed camera angle that gives an isometric-like view.
So to clarify for the user - V Rising has that isometric "feel" but it's actually a full 3D engine with 3D models, just with a fixed overhead camera. This is good news for him because it means he can get that look without dealing with 2D sprite limitations.DoneTechnically no - V Rising is full 3D with a fixed overhead camera that gives an isometric-like perspective. This is actually good news for you.
What this means:

It's a 3D engine (Unity) with 3D models and environments
The camera is locked at a fixed angle looking down
You get all the benefits of 3D (dynamic lighting, shadows, particle effects, smooth rotation) without the complexity of a free camera system
It avoids that flat 2D sprite look that can feel dated

This style is sometimes called "3/4 view" or "top-down 3D" rather than true isometric. Games like Diablo 3, Lost Ark, and League of Legends use the same approach.
For your MajorMUD project this is actually the sweet spot:

Easier than full free-camera 3D (no camera collision, indoor/outdoor transitions, etc.)
Looks way better than 2D isometric sprites
Asset creation is more forgiving than first-person 3D (characters are smaller on screen, less detail needed)
Works great for real-time PvX combat (you can see the battlefield)

Unity or Godot 4 would both handle this style well. Want to start sketching out what a prototype might look like - maybe a single dungeon room with movement and basic combat?Yes and build a prototypeFeb 5Deliberated tech stack and architected browser-based game prototypeThe user wants to build a prototype of a MajorMUD-inspired game with V Rising style graphics (3D top-down view). Let me think about what this would involve:

First, I should read the relevant skill files to see if there are any that apply
Then plan out a prototype

For a game prototype, I don't think there's a specific skill for this. The frontend-design skill might have some relevance but this is more about game development.
Let me think about what a minimal prototype would look like:

3D environment (a dungeon room)
Player character that can move
Fixed overhead camera
Basic combat (maybe click to attack)
Maybe a simple enemy

For the tech stack, we have a few options:

Godot 4 - would need to be installed, user would need to download
Unity - same, requires installation
Web-based with Three.js - could run in browser, user could see it immediately

Given that we're in a container environment and the user wants to see something quickly, a Three.js prototype might be the fastest way to show something tangible. It won't be as full-featured as a proper game engine, but it can demonstrate the concept.
Alternatively, I could create a more detailed design document and then build something simple.
Let me ask the user what they prefer - a quick web-based demo or setting up a proper game engine project structure.
Actually, let me just start building something. A Three.js prototype would let them see something immediately in their browser. I can create:

A dungeon floor/room
A simple player character (could be a placeholder capsule/cube for now)
WASD movement
Fixed overhead camera
Maybe some simple lighting

Let me build this as an HTML file with Three.js.Show moreI've asked the user what they want in the prototype and what tech they prefer. Let me wait for their response.DoneLet's do it. A few quick questions to scope the prototype:Q: What should the prototype include?
A: Dungeon room with walls, Player movement (WASD), Basic enemy that attacks, Click-to-attack combatQ: Tech preference?
A: Unity project - industry standardFeb 5Architected modular Unity prototype with player, enemy, and combat systemsThe user wants a Unity prototype with:

Dungeon room with walls
Player movement (WASD)
Basic enemy that attacks
Click-to-attack combat

I should create a Unity project structure with the necessary scripts. Let me build out a prototype that they can download and open in Unity.
I'll need to create:

Project structure
Player controller script (WASD movement, click-to-attack)
Enemy AI script (basic attack behavior)
Camera controller (fixed overhead angle like V Rising)
A simple scene setup guide or prefab instructions
Maybe a basic combat system

Next steps when you're ready: character models, animations, spells/abilities, networking for multiplayer. Want me to tackle any of those?Majormud prototypeZIP DownloadSo the environment can look as good as v rising immediately?Feb 5Weighed prototype's visual limitations against professional game polish standardsThe user is asking if the prototype I just created will look as good as V Rising right away. I need to be honest here - no, absolutely not. V Rising has:

Professional 3D artists creating detailed models
Custom shaders and materials
Carefully crafted lighting
Particle effects everywhere
Post-processing (bloom, color grading, ambient occlusion, etc.)
Animated vegetation, cloth, etc.
Years of development and polish

What I gave them is primitive cubes and capsules with basic materials. It's a functional prototype for testing gameplay mechanics, not a visual showcase.
I should be direct about this and explain what it would take to get closer to V Rising's look.Show moreDoneNo, not even close. I should be straight with you.
What I gave you is gray boxes and capsules. It's a functional prototype to test movement and combat mechanics. Visually it looks like programmer art from 2003.
What V Rising has that this doesn't:

Hand-modeled 3D environments (stone walls, floors with detail, props)
PBR materials with normal maps, roughness, ambient occlusion
Detailed character and enemy models with animations
Particle effects (torches, magic, dust, blood)
Post-processing stack (bloom, color grading, fog, vignette)
Dynamic lighting with baked global illumination
Vegetation, props, clutter that make spaces feel lived-in
Custom shaders for water, fire, magic effects

To get closer to V Rising's look, you'd need:

Asset packs - This is the fastest path. Unity Asset Store has dungeon/gothic packs that would instantly transform the look. Budget $50-200 for a cohesive set.
Post-processing - Add Unity's Post Processing package. Bloom, ambient occlusion, and color grading alone make a huge difference. Free, takes 30 minutes.
Better lighting - Baked lightmaps, point lights for torches, volumetric fog.
Character models - Mixamo for free rigged characters, or asset store packs.

Want me to show you how to set up post-processing and recommend some asset packs that would get you 70% of the way to that V Rising feel?So do I setup a GitHub repo and cacode?Feb 5Evaluated GitHub setup and Claude Code integration for development workflowThe user is asking about setting up a GitHub repo and using Claude Code (cacode) for this project. This makes sense - they want to set up a proper development workflow.
Claude Code is Anthropic's command line tool for agentic coding. It would be a good fit for this kind of iterative game development project.
I should give them practical advice on:

Setting up a GitHub repo for Unity
Using Claude Code for development
The workflow they'd use

I should keep it practical and straightforward.Show moreDoneYeah, that's the right move for a real project. Here's the setup:
1. Create GitHub Repo
bash# In your Unity project folder
git init
git branch -M main
2. Add Unity .gitignore
Critical - Unity projects have tons of generated files you don't want to commit. Grab the standard one:
bashcurl -o .gitignore https://raw.githubusercontent.com/github/gitignore/main/Unity.gitignore
3. First Commit
bashgit add .
git commit -m "Initial prototype - movement, combat, enemy AI"
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/majormud-3d.git
git push -u origin main
4. Claude Code
Once the repo exists, you can use Claude Code to iterate:
bashclaude
Then just tell it what you want:

"Add a fireball spell the player can cast with right-click"
"Make enemies drop loot when they die"
"Set up Unity's post-processing stack with bloom and color grading"
"Create an inventory system"

Claude Code can edit your C# scripts directly, create new ones, and even help with Unity-specific stuff like setting up ScriptableObjects for items.
One Tip: Keep the Unity editor open while using Claude Code. After it edits scripts, Unity will auto-recompile and you can test immediately.
Want me to write out a roadmap of features to tackle in order, so you have a clear backlog to work through with Claude Code?VscodeFeb 5Inferred VSCode setup intent for Unity developmentThe user is asking about VSCode - they probably want to know how to set up VSCode for Unity C# development, or they're clarifying that they use VSCode rather than Claude Code. Let me give them a quick setup for VSCode with Unity.DoneRight, for Unity C# development:
VSCode Setup

Install C# Dev Kit extension (Microsoft's official one)
In Unity: Edit > Preferences > External Tools > External Script Editor → set to VSCode
Generate project files: In Unity, Edit > Preferences > External Tools > click "Regenerate project files"

Now double-clicking any script in Unity opens it in VSCode with full IntelliSense.
Useful Extensions

C# Dev Kit (required)
Unity (by Microsoft) - Unity-specific snippets and debugging
GitHub Copilot - if you have it

Workflow
Unity (open) ←→ VSCode (edit scripts) ←→ GitHub (version control)

Edit scripts in VSCode
Save (Ctrl+S)
Alt-Tab to Unity - it auto-recompiles
Press Play to test
Commit when something works

Git from VSCode
VSCode has built-in Git support (Source Control panel on the left sidebar), or use the terminal:
bashgit add .
git commit -m "Added fireball spell"
git push
That's it. You're set to start building. Grab a dungeon asset pack from the Unity Asset Store and the game will start looking like something real pretty quick.So met with some moderate success but I need to know if there are unit scenes premade that I can download. The learning curve with unity is steep I am using Linux and finding making changes very difficult and I want to set this up as an automated thing as much as possibleFeb 6Weighed asset store templates against Godot's Linux-friendly automation potentialThe user is struggling with Unity's learning curve on Linux and wants pre-made scenes/templates they can download and modify. They want automation to reduce the manual Unity editor work.
Let me think about what options exist:

Unity Asset Store - Has complete game templates, dungeon kits, etc. But these still require Unity editor knowledge.
Open source Unity projects on GitHub - There are complete game projects they could fork and modify.
The real issue - Unity on Linux is notoriously painful. The editor works but has quirks. And Unity's GUI-heavy workflow doesn't lend itself well to automation.
Alternative: Godot - Actually runs great on Linux, has a more code-centric workflow, and can be automated via CLI. GDScript or C#. This might be a better fit.
Headless/CLI Unity - Unity can be run headless for builds, but scene creation still needs the editor.

Let me search for some options:

Complete Unity dungeon crawler templates
Open source V Rising-like projects
Godot alternatives that might work better for their workflow

I should be honest that Unity on Linux with an automation-focused workflow is fighting upstream. Godot might genuinely be a better fit here.Show moreDoneHonestly? Unity on Linux with an automation-first workflow is fighting uphill. Unity is very GUI-dependent.
Two paths forward:

Option A: Grab a Complete Unity Template
These exist and would skip a lot of the learning curve:

"Top Down Engine" by More Mountains (~$70) - complete action RPG framework, V Rising style camera, combat, enemies, all wired up
"ARPG Project" on Asset Store - full Diablo-style game template
"Dungeon Template" - search Asset Store for complete dungeon crawlers

You'd still need to use the Unity editor, but you're modifying a working game instead of building from scratch.

Option B: Switch to Godot
Given your situation, this might actually make more sense:

Native Linux support (first-class, not an afterthought)
Scenes are text files (.tscn) - you can edit them with code/scripts
CLI support for builds and automation
C# or GDScript
Lighter weight, faster iteration
Free, open source

There are also complete Godot templates:

"Topdown Shooter Template" on itch.io
Several ARPG starter kits on GitHub


Which sounds better to you - finding a Unity template to modify, or pivoting to Godot where automation is actually realistic?I also have a windows machine. Does that make a difference? Can godot to great quality isometric 3d?Feb 6Weighed Windows advantages for Unity against Godot's improved 3D capabilitiesThe user is asking two things:

Does having a Windows machine change the recommendation?
Can Godot do great quality isometric 3D?

Let me address both:

Windows machine - Yes, this changes things significantly for Unity. Unity on Windows is the primary supported platform, much better experience, easier to use, more tutorials assume Windows, etc.
Godot for isometric 3D quality - Godot 4 has significantly improved 3D capabilities. It can definitely do good quality 3D now with:


Vulkan renderer
Global illumination (SDFGI, VoxelGI)
Signed distance field ambient occlusion
Volumetric fog
Screen-space reflections
Good PBR materials

However, Unity still has advantages:

Much larger asset store ecosystem
More polished 3D pipeline
More tutorials and resources
More AAA-quality assets available
Better out-of-box visual quality

But Godot 4 can absolutely produce good looking games now. Games like "Cassette Beasts", "Brotato", "Dome Keeper" were made in Godot (though those are 2D). For 3D, there are some impressive Godot 4 demos.
The honest assessment:

If he wants the best visual quality with least effort: Unity on Windows + Asset Store packs
If he wants automation/scripting-first workflow: Godot
If he wants both: Godot 4 can get close but requires more manual work for visuals

I should give him a straight answer and maybe show examples of what Godot 4 can do visually.Show moreDoneYes, Windows changes things. Unity on Windows is the intended experience - it's way smoother.
Godot 4 3D Quality
Godot 4 made huge improvements. It can look good now:

Vulkan renderer
Real PBR materials
Global illumination (SDFGI)
Volumetric fog
Good shadow quality
Post-processing

Search YouTube for "Godot 4 3D showcase" or "Godot 4 realistic graphics" - you'll see it's capable of solid visuals now.

My Take
Since you have Windows available: Use Unity on Windows for the editor work, but keep your code in Git so you can still script/automate from Linux when needed.
Grab the Top Down Engine asset ($70) or similar complete template. You'll have a working V Rising-style game in an afternoon instead of months.
Want me to find specific Unity templates that would fit MajorMUD's style?But you said unit requires GUI editing right?Feb 6Acknowledged contradiction between GUI dependency and automation goalsThe user is asking for clarification. I said Unity is GUI-dependent, but then suggested using it on Windows. They're pointing out the contradiction - if Unity requires GUI editing, that conflicts with their goal of automation.
Let me be clear about this:

Unity does require GUI work for scene setup, prefab creation, component configuration, asset importing, etc.
The scripts (C#) can be edited in VSCode/text editor
But wiring things together - dragging scripts onto objects, setting references in the Inspector, configuring materials, importing assets - that's all GUI

So if they want automation-first, Unity isn't the right choice regardless of OS. Godot's scene files are text-based (TSCN format), so you can actually script scene creation and modification.
I should correct myself and be honest - if automation is the priority, Godot is the better choice even though they have Windows available.Show moreDoneYou're right, I contradicted myself.
Unity requires GUI work for:

Creating/editing scenes
Attaching scripts to objects
Setting up prefabs
Configuring materials
Importing and assigning assets
Setting component values in Inspector

The C# code is text, but everything else is click-and-drag in the editor. You can't really automate that away.
Godot is different:

.tscn scene files are human-readable text
.tres resource files are also text
You can generate/modify scenes with scripts
CLI tools for builds
Everything can be version controlled meaningfully

Example - a Godot scene file looks like this:
[node name="Enemy" type="CharacterBody3D"]
transform = Transform3D(1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 5, 0, 3)
script = ExtResource("1_abc123")

[node name="CollisionShape3D" type="CollisionShape3D" parent="."]
shape = SubResource("CapsuleShape3D_xyz")
You could write a Python script to generate 50 enemy variants from a spreadsheet. Can't do that with Unity.
Bottom line: If automation is a real priority, Godot is the right call regardless of having Windows. Unity's strength is the GUI workflow and asset store, not scriptability.
Want me to build out a Godot 4 prototype instead?How do you make godot look good? I want to be ripping out high quality dungeons very quickly and storey driven content and exploration is really important but I don't want sucky grafics eitherFeb 6Synthesized Godot optimization strategies for rapid dungeon creationThe user wants to know how to make Godot look good for their MajorMUD-inspired game. They want:

High quality dungeons produced quickly
Story-driven content
Exploration focus
Good graphics

Let me think about what makes Godot 4 look good:

Asset packs - there are some good ones on itch.io and the Godot asset library
Post-processing - Godot 4 has good post-processing
Lighting - proper lighting setup
Materials/shaders
The right art style choice

For quick dungeon creation, they'd want:

Modular dungeon kits (tile-based or modular pieces)
Procedural generation potentially
A good workflow for level design

Let me give them practical advice on how to achieve good visuals in Godot 4 quickly.Show moreDoneGood graphics in Godot 4 comes down to three things: assets, lighting, and post-processing.
1. Assets - This is 80% of the look
The secret: use modular 3D dungeon kits made for game engines. These exist:

Synty Studios - Low-poly stylized packs (work in any engine, export as FBX)
Kenney - Free modular dungeon kit
Quaternius - Free low-poly packs
Kay Lousberg - Free dungeon assets
Sketchfab - Tons of CC0 dungeon pieces
itch.io - Search "3D dungeon assets Godot"

Modular means pieces snap together like LEGO - floor tiles, wall sections, corners, doors, stairs. You build dungeons fast by placing pieces.
2. Lighting
Godot 4 has:

SDFGI (global illumination) - makes everything look grounded
Volumetric fog - instant atmosphere
Baked lightmaps for performance
Omni lights for torches

One directional light + a few point lights for torches + fog = instant dungeon mood.
3. Post-Processing (WorldEnvironment node)

Glow/bloom on light sources
Tone mapping
SSAO (ambient occlusion) - adds depth in corners
Color correction - push it darker/moodier
Vignette

Quick Dungeon Workflow
Modular pieces → Snap together in editor → Add lights → Tweak post-processing
Want me to build a Godot 4 prototype with proper lighting and post-processing already configured, plus find you the best free dungeon asset packs to drop in?I don't care if I have to pay for assets I just thought they all had to be unity. You mean ones we see on unity stre can be used I. Godot?Feb 6Clarified asset format compatibility across game enginesThe user is asking about asset compatibility between Unity and Godot. Let me clarify this:

Unity Asset Store assets - these are typically Unity-specific packages (.unitypackage) that include Unity-specific components, prefabs, materials, etc. These don't directly work in Godot.
However, many assets contain standard 3D formats like FBX, OBJ, GLTF that CAN be exported/used in any engine.
There are also asset stores that are engine-agnostic:


Sketchfab
Turbosquid
CGTrader
Humble Bundle game dev bundles
itch.io
Synty (sells on multiple stores, FBX format)


Some Unity assets CAN be extracted - if you buy a Unity asset, you can often extract the FBX files and textures and use them in Godot. But it's not always straightforward.

Let me clarify this for the user.Show moreDoneNot directly, but here's the deal:
Unity Asset Store - Those packages are Unity-specific. The prefabs, materials, scripts won't work. BUT many include the raw FBX/GLTF files and textures which you could extract and import into Godot. It's extra work and a gray area legally.
Engine-Agnostic Stores - This is what you want:
StoreWhat's TherePrice RangeSynty Studios (syntystore.com)Gorgeous low-poly packs, dungeons, characters, everything$20-50 per packSketchfabMassive library, many free/CC0Free - $50Humble BundleGame dev bundles with 3D assets (FBX format)$25 for huge bundlesitch.ioIndie asset packs$5-30TurbosquidProfessional 3D models$10-500CGTraderSame dealVariesKitbash3DHigh-end environment kits$50+QuaterniusFree low-poly packsFree
Synty is probably your answer. Their "POLYGON Dungeon Realms" pack is exactly what you need - modular dungeon pieces, enemies, props, all in FBX format that imports directly into Godot.
Search "Synty dungeon" and look at the screenshots. That quality, snapping together like LEGO, works in Godot out of the box.
Want me to build the Godot prototype while you grab some assets?For example synty studios stuffoik good for unity bsame for godot?Feb 6Evaluated asset compatibility across engines with caveatsThe user is asking if Synty Studios assets that look good in Unity will look the same/good in Godot.
The answer is yes, mostly. Synty sells FBX files which are universal 3D model files. The geometry, UVs, and textures work in any engine.
However, there are some caveats:

Materials may need to be recreated in Godot (assign textures to Godot materials)
Unity-specific prefabs won't transfer
Shaders might need adjustment
But the actual look - the models, textures, style - that's all the same

Synty's low-poly style actually works great because it's not relying on complex shaders or engine-specific tricks. It's clean geometry with hand-painted or simple textures.Show moreDoneYes, same assets, same look.
Synty sells FBX files - that's a universal 3D format. The models, textures, and style are identical regardless of engine.
What you get:

.fbx files (3D models) → Import into Godot directly
.png textures → Work anywhere
The low-poly stylized look is baked into the geometry itself

What you DON'T get (Unity-only):

Pre-made prefabs
Pre-configured materials (you set these up in Godot, takes 5 min per asset)
Unity scripts

The actual visual style transfers 100%. Synty's look comes from the model geometry and texture art, not engine magic.
Here's the workflow:
Download Synty pack → Drag FBX into Godot → Assign textures to materials → Done
Godot 4 even auto-detects most material setups on import now.
So yes - buy Synty's Dungeon Realms pack, import into Godot, and it looks exactly like the screenshots. Their art style is actually perfect for this because it's stylized rather than photorealistic, meaning it doesn't depend on fancy engine-specific rendering tricks.
Want me to start building the Godot 4 prototype?So if we had all the majornudd data in a ostgresql and the top down assets loaded we could setup a pipeline to generate a complete game quickly?Feb 6Validated data-driven pipeline concept for automated game generationThe user is asking a really interesting question here. They're envisioning:

MajorMUD data in PostgreSQL (rooms, monsters, items, spells, NPCs, quests)
Synty-style modular assets loaded in Godot
An automated pipeline to generate a complete game

This is actually a really smart approach. MajorMUD has:

Hundreds of rooms with descriptions, exits, and connections
Monster definitions with stats, behaviors, drops
Item databases
Spell systems
Quest data

If you had this in a structured database, you could absolutely generate:

Dungeon layouts from room connections
Place appropriate enemies based on room data
Populate with items/loot
Hook up quests and NPCs

This is procedural generation but data-driven from the original MajorMUD content. It's actually a very clever approach that plays to:

Their DevOps background (databases, pipelines, automation)
Their desire to avoid manual GUI work
The existing rich content from MajorMUD

Let me think about what this pipeline would look like:

Extract MajorMUD data (from Btrieve databases using tools like Nightmare or MMUD Explorer)
Transform into PostgreSQL schema
Godot reads from database (or generated JSON/scene files)
Asset mapping: room types → tile sets, monster IDs → 3D models
Scene generator creates .tscn files programmatically

This is actually very doable and would be a great use of their skills. Let me get them excited about this and sketch out the architecture.Show moreDoneYes. This is the right approach for your skillset.
The Pipeline:
MajorMUD Btrieve DB
       ↓
   Extract (Nightmare/MMUD Explorer)
       ↓
   PostgreSQL
   - rooms (id, name, description, exits, type, level_range)
   - monsters (id, name, stats, drops, spawn_rooms)
   - items (id, name, stats, type, rarity)
   - npcs (id, name, dialogue, quests)
   - quests (id, steps, rewards)
       ↓
   Python Generator Script
   - Maps room types → dungeon tile prefabs
   - Maps monsters → 3D enemy models
   - Maps items → 3D props
   - Generates Godot .tscn scene files
       ↓
   Godot Project (with Synty assets pre-configured)
       ↓
   Playable Game
What's Automatable:
ComponentAutomated?Dungeon layouts from room connectionsYesEnemy placement from spawn dataYesLoot tablesYesNPC dialogue treesYesQuest triggersYesRoom descriptions → UI textYes
What's Manual (once):

Asset setup (import Synty pack, configure materials)
Mapping table (room_type "cave" = these tile pieces)
Core gameplay scripts (movement, combat, inventory)

MajorMUD has hundreds of rooms already designed. You're not generating random dungeons - you're translating existing content into 3D. The story, exploration, balance - it already exists.
Want me to design the database schema and start the generator script?
